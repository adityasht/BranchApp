### Branch is an interactive iOS application meant to improve human relationships and develop habits associated with positive mental health.

An app that fosters real-life connections is valuable because it promotes deeper, more meaningful relationships, which are essential for mental and emotional well-being. Unlike digital interactions, face-to-face connections provide trust, empathy, and support, reducing stress and loneliness. Research shows that people with strong in-person networks are happier and healthier. By encouraging these real-life interactions, the app can help build stronger communities, enhance social cohesion, and support overall mental health, making it a powerful tool for positive social change.

The Harvard Study of Adult Development, one of the longest studies on human happiness, found that close **relationships**, more than money or fame, are what keep people happy throughout their lives. Encouraging people to connect face-to-face can foster a sense of community, reduce social isolation, and promote mental health, making Branch a powerful tool for positive social change.

Branch enables users to make plans with real people, in real life, therefore fostering these close relationships that will ultimately keep them happy throughout their lives.

### Database
The database uses SQL for structured data management and is accessed through AWS, ensuring reliable storage and scalability. It holds data related to users, messages, and any other necessary app entities.

### Login
Login functionality is implemented using Flask to create RESTful client and server applications, with the Instagrapi library used to manage and authenticate user accounts, allowing seamless integration with Instagram services.

### Messaging
Messaging between users is managed through dedicated client-server architecture and handler scripts, enabling real-time communication and interactions within the app.

### Frontend
The frontend is developed using React and TypeScript, providing a dynamic and type-safe environment for building user interfaces and components. This allows for quick iteration and ensures a responsive user experience across all pages and features.

### Generative AI
The Generative AI functionality leverages a Hugging Face large language model (LLM) to match users based on their interests. This AI-powered approach enhances user interactions and social connections by prioritizing relevant branches in the app's nearby search based on interest recommendations.
